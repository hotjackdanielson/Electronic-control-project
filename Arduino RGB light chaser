/* This code uses pins 11, 10, and 9 for the red, green, and blue pins of the RGB LED, respectively. 
I'm using a common anode RGB LED and connect the common pin to a positive voltage source (the 5V pin on the Arduino).
In the setup() function, the code sets the RGB LED pins as outputs. 
In the loop() function, the code turns on the red LED for a short period of time, 
then turns it off and turns on the green LED, and so on. 
This creates a "chasing" effect where the RGB LED appears to change color in a sequence.*/

int redPin = 11; // Define the pins for the RGB LED
int greenPin = 10;
int bluePin = 9;

int delayTime = 1000; // Define the delay between LED transitions

void setup() {

  pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);  // Set the RGB LED pins as outputs
  pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(redPin, HIGH);  // Turn on the red LED
  delay(delayTime);

  digitalWrite(redPin, LOW);  // Turn off the red LED and turn on the green LED
  digitalWrite(greenPin, HIGH);
  delay(delayTime);
  digitalWrite(greenPin, LOW);   // Turn off the green LED and turn on the blue LED
  digitalWrite(bluePin, HIGH);
  delay(delayTime);
  digitalWrite(bluePin, LOW);   // Turn off the blue LED
}
