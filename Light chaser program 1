/*This code uses an array of 8 LED pins, 
which are set as outputs in the setup() function. 
In the loop() function, the code turns on each LED in sequence, 
delays for a short period of time, 
and then turns off each LED in sequence. 
This process repeats indefinitely, 
creating a "chasing" effect where the LEDs appear 
to move in a line.
