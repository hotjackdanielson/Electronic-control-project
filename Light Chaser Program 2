/*This code uses an array of 8 LED pins, which are set as outputs in the setup() function. 
In the loop() function, the code turns on each LED in sequence, delays for a short period of time, 
and then turns off the previous LED before moving on to the next one. 
This creates a "chasing" effect where the LEDs appear to move in a line.
After all the LEDs have been turned on in sequence, the code turns off the 
last LED before starting the reverse sequence. This time, the code turns on each LED in reverse 
sequence, delays for a short period of time, and then turns off the previous LED before moving on to 
the next one. Again, this creates a "chasing" effect where the LEDs appear to move in a line, 
but in the opposite direction.*/
