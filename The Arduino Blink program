/*This code uses pin 13, which is connected to an on-board LED on my Arduino board. 
Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
In the setup() function, the code sets the LED pin as an output. 
In the loop() function, the code turns on the LED, waits for 1 second using the delay() function, turns off the LED, and waits for another 1 second. 
This process repeats indefinitely, causing the LED to blink on and off at a regular interval.

You can adjust the delay() function calls to change the blinking speed of the LED.*/
int LEDpin = 13; // Define the pin for the LED

void setup() {
 
  pinMode(LEDpin, OUTPUT);// Set the LED pin as an output
}

void loop() {

  digitalWrite(LEDpin, HIGH); // Turn on the LED
 
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
  
  digitalWrite(LEDpin, LOW); // Turn off the LED
 
  delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
